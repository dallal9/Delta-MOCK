# Delta-MOCK

**Delta-MOCK** is a new version of the *multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination 
(MOCK)* algorithm. MOCK is an evolutionary approach to multiobjective data clustering, originally 
proposed by Julia Handl and Joshua Knowles [1]. Our new algorithm Delta-MOCK presents extensive 
changes and improves upon the effectiveness and computational efficiency of MOCK. This translates 
into a better scalability which is essential given the unprecedented volumes of data that require 
to be processed in current clustering applications.

Delta-MOCK is described in detail in our paper:

	Mario Garza-Fabre, Julia Handl and Joshua Knowles. 
	An Improved and More Scalable Evolutionary Approach to Multiobjective Clustering.
	IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation (accepted for publication).

The **source code** of the implementation of Delta-MOCK studied in our paper, as well as our 
collection of test **data sets**, is made available through this repository.
