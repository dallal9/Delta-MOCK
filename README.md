# Delta-MOCK
## Delta-MOCK algorithm for Evolutionary Multiobjective Clustering

**Delta-MOCK** is a new version of the *multiobjective clustering with automatic k-determination 
(MOCK)* algorithm. MOCK is an evolutionary approach to multiobjective data clustering, originally 
proposed by Julia Handl and Joshua Knowles [1]. Our new algorithm Delta-MOCK presents extensive 
changes and improves upon the effectiveness and computational efficiency of MOCK. This translates 
into a better scalability which is essential given the unprecedented volumes of data that require 
to be processed in current clustering applications.

Delta-MOCK is described in detail in our paper:

	Mario Garza-Fabre, Julia Handl and Joshua Knowles. 
	**An Improved and More Scalable Evolutionary Approach to Multiobjective Clustering**.

which was submitted to **IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation** and is currently under
review. The source code of Delta-MOCK, as well as all of the test data sets used during the 
experimentation of this study, will be made available through our GitHub repository once this
paper is published: [https://github.com/garzafabre/Delta-MOCK](https://github.com/garzafabre/Delta-MOCK)
